                  The game is a 3D Platformer-Shooter played on a mobile device.
                  The player controls a wanderer named Riona, who is on a
                  mission to eliminate an enemy invasion force in the Imperial
                  castle. She must make use of her skills, her agility,
                  marksmanship, and magical skills to clear the castle of all
                  intruders.

                  In this project I was responsible for implementing character
                  contoller, Camera contoller, player movement and animations. I also programmed a
                  save and load system for all the elements in the game.

                      This is a 3D puzzle game, in which the player should use a pick and a wrench to pick a lock. Therefore, it can be used in modern 
                      games. The player can find the sweet spot by rotating the wrench 90 degrees to left and right and once 
                      the sweet spot was found, they should rotate the pick 90 degrees to left and right towards the sweet spot 
                      to pick the lock. While rotating the pick, the player should also rotate the wrench to hold the sweet spot. 
                      If they lose the sweet spot, the lock is going to break.

                      This game is a 2D grid based game inspired from Cyber Punk which the player should find a sequence of code
                      based on a given sequence. Once the game loads, the player should find the codes before the time runs 
                      out. When the player clicks on a correct code a row or a column which that code is in them will be 
                      highlighted to show the player where to choose the next from. If the player clicks on the wrong code, 
                      they will lose 5 seconds. Also, if the player doesn’t find the next code in the highlighted row or column, 
                      they can start creating the sequence again by clicking on the start over button with the penalty of losing
                      5 seconds.

                      This game is a 2D grid based game in which the player should  form lines, chains, or groups of three or  more of the same elements. Once the player puts the similar ones next to each other, they disappear and new tiles will be filling empty spots from bottom to top of the grid.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                      There are three different levels of difficulty in this game: Easy, Normal, Hard
Easy: in this mode the player should the reach the maximum score in less than 2 minutes.
The number of matches in this mode is 3 or more. The maximum score is 220.
Normal: in this mode player should match 4 or more tiles and the maximum score is 250.
Also, the player has 90 seconds to finish the level.
Hard: in this mode the maximum score is 280 and the time limit is 70 seconds. Also, the player has to 
match 5 or more tiles.
In Normal and Hard modes, when the tiles get matched, there is chance of spawning a tile with fence 
icon. This tile is not moveable and therefore it cannot be flipped.
